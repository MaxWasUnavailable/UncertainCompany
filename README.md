**Uncertain Company** is a mod which throws a wrench into your long-term planning. The company no longer provides you with
information regarding a moon's weather, item sales are no longer guaranteed to be *cheaper* (but might also be a *lot* cheaper), 
and the company might just screw you over on the final day - *or* give you a little bonus. Oh, and did we mention that
travel to free moons might not *always* be free anymore?

But hey, at least fuel costs to travel to moons like Titan are a bit cheaper from time to time!

## Features
- Hides moon weather information
  > You will *not* know what the weather is like on a moon before landing on it. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.
- Adds chance to slightly increase or decrease existing sales %
  > Items could cost slightly less, or slightly more, when they're on sale. It *is* possible for items to be *more* expensive
  > than normal during a sale. 
- Adds chance to slightly increase or decrease company selling %
  > Waiting until the final day to sell *might* not always be the optimal choice. Are you a gambler?
- Adds chance to make free moons paid for a day, and slightly randomises moon travel costs.
  > Wait for that one quota where Titan is 20% cheaper, and hope you don't run into a quota where the only option is Assurance.

## Configurability
Each feature can be enabled or disabled through the configuration file.

## Compatibility
This mod *should* be compatible with most mods, except for those mods that drastically alter methods this mod patches.

Note that you should be able to selectively disable features from my mod to help with any compatibility issues.

***Technically*, only the host needs to have this mod installed.** However, any clients that do not have this mod
installed will not be able to see the changes made by this mod. (E.g. they will still see the weather information, 
and will have regular sales % -- which kind of beats the point of this mod.)
